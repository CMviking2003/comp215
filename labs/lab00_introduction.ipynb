        "  *  *Google Colaboratory (Colab), is a free, cloud-based environment for writing and running Python code in a browser. It's a popular tool in the data science and machine learning communities for tasks that require a lot of computing power, such as: Analyzing large amounts of data, Training machine learning models, and Testing deep learning algorithms.*  \n",

        "Colab is an online interactive Python notebook environment.  An interactive notebook is a programming environment that allows you to interlace code, formatted text, data, and graphical output all in a single document. These notebooks are easy to distribute on the web and can be viewed and executed without any additional software installation or configuration, making them an ideal platform for sharing research and analysis. They are widely used in scientific computing and in data science applications where the emphasis is on using code to clearly communicate rather than building an end-user app.  Interactive Python notebooks use the file extension `.ipynb` instead of `.py`.  \n",

        "You can find more information about Jupyter Notebooks at [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/).  Note that you do not need to install Jupyter on your computer because we are using Colab.  In a notebook you write the code in Python and the text Markdown.  You can find more information about the Markdown language at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org).  We will be using Colab in this course as the default (but not required) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for you to write and run Python code.  "
