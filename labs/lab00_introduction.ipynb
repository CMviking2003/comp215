An interactive notebook is a programming environment that allows you to interlace code, formatted text, data, and graphical output all in a single document. These notebooks are easy to distribute on the web and can be viewed and executed without any additional software installation or configuration, making them an ideal platform for sharing research and analysis. They are widely used in scientific computing and in data science applications where the emphasis is on using code to clearly communicate rather than building an end-user app.  Interactive Python notebooks use the file extension `.ipynb` instead of `.py`.  \n",

In a notebook you write the code in Python and the text Markdown.  You can find more information about the Markdown language at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org).
